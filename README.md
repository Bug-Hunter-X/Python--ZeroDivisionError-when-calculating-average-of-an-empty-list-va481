This repository demonstrates a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers: a ZeroDivisionError when dealing with an empty list. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from dividing by the length of the list without checking for emptiness beforehand. The solution shows how to gracefully handle this case by returning 0 or raising a more informative exception.
